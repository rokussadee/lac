the studio is acoustically treated in order to be as isolated as possible. No sounds from outside will disturb you once the doors are closed, and you won&apos;t disturb anyone as long as you don&apos;t play harsh-noise.
</p></br><p>
It has been designed to have a pretty fair amount of liveness, but can also be dampened using thick carpet and/or curtains.</p></br><p>IDEAL for recordings.</p><br><h2>concert hall</h2><p>This room is a little more rough than the 1st floor, resulting in a more "living" sound, which can be significantly lowered with heavy duty curtains made for that purpose.
</p><br><p>Fully equipped - this is our main concert room - with powerful sound system / video / lights.</p><br><p>IDEAL for concert rehearsing / theatre / practicing.</p>
